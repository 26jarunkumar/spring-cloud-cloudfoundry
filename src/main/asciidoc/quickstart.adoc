Add this project to a Spring Boot REST service and deploy to
Cloudfoundry (and use the Actuator for maximum flexibility). It will
expose service-broker endpoints automatically (look in /mappings for
/v2/*) and you can register it with the Cloud Controller as described
here:
http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html[http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html].
