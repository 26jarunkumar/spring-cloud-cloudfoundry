Spring Cloud for Cloudfoundry makes it easy to run
https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud] apps in
https://github.com/cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry] (the Platform as a
Service). Cloud Foundry has the notion of a "service", which is
middlware that you "bind" to an app, essentially providing it with an
environment variable containing credentials (e.g. the location and
username to use for the service).

This project provides an implementation of Spring Cloud Commons `DiscoveryClient` so you can `@EnableDiscoveryClient`
and provide your credentials as `spring.cloud.cloudfoundry.discovery.[email,password]` and then you can use the
`DiscoveryClient` directly or via a `LoadBalancerClient` (also `*.url` if you are not connecting to [Pivotal Web
Services](https://run.pivotal.io)).
