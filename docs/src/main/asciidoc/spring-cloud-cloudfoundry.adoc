= Spring Cloud for Cloud Foundry

include::intro.adoc[]

The first time you use it the discovery client might be slow owing to
the fact that it has to get an access token from Cloud Foundry.

=== Single Sign On

NOTE: All of the OAuth2 SSO and resource server features moved to Spring Boot
in version 1.3. You can find documentation in the 
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot user guide].

This project provides automatic binding from CloudFoundry service
credentials to the Spring Boot features. If you have a CloudFoundry
service called "sso", for instance, with credentials containing
"client_id", "client_secret" and "auth_domain", it will bind
automatically to the Spring OAuth2 client that you enable with
`@EnableOAuth2Sso` (from Spring Boot). The name of the service can be
parameterized using `spring.oauth2.sso.serviceId`.
